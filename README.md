## General Information
The project tasks us with using analytics to examine bank loan data. We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand how consumer attributes influence default tendencies.
EDA helps identify patterns and strong indicators of loan defaults. Our responsibilities include managing missing data, spotting outliers, and addressing any data imbalances.
We are required to explain results from univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analyses, gaining insights into variable relationships and their impact on defaults.
The final objective is determining the factors that banks should consider before issuing new loans

## Conclusions
Grade 'B' and Sub-Grade 'B5' loans consistently exhibit the highest charge-offs, highlighting a critical risk area for lenders.
The Approved Loan Amount Percentage, indicating that a majority of loans were fully funded, reflects a positive trend in the lending portfolio.
Loans within the 5000−10000 range face a heightened risk of charge-offs, emphasizing the need for careful assessment in this loan bracket.
Loans sanctioned in December 2011 pose an elevated risk of charge-offs, suggesting potential external factors influencing loan defaults during that specific time frame.
Overall, key risk factors contributing to charge-offs include not verified status, rented accommodations, debt consolidation loan purposes, interest rates ranging from 9% to 14.5%, and Grade 'F' and 'G' loans with higher amounts and longer tenures.
